QuickStart

VS JavaScript Integration

Reference the VS javascript api library.
Add the VineSpring script reference to the bottom of your template: 
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://platform.vinespring.com/scripts/2.0/all.js"></script>
Add the “cart and login” links to your template by adding the following tag:
<div data-vsPlugin="accountLinks"></div>
Since account links uses a div that is designed to be hidden, and appear when the users adds something to their cart, you’ll want to add the following style (at a minimum) to your CSS:
#vsModal { display: none; }
It’s recommended to absolutely position the account/cart links in the upper right hand corner of the page, but this certainly isn’t “mandatory”. Choose the spot that best meshes with your design. The primary goal is just to make them easily accessible to the site visitor, and the upper right is very common around the web.
Create an account page at /account, and add this tag to the body.
<div data-vsPlugin="account"></div>
Create a user registration page at /register, and add this tag to the body.
<div data-vsPlugin="registration"></div>
